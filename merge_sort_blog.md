### Merge Sort
  - Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm based on the idea of breaking down a list into sub lists of single element and then merging those sub lists into a sorted list
  - It is a stable sort, more efficient at handling sequential media
  - Quick sort implementations are generally efficient than merge sort. Heap sort requires less space
  - Merge sort is often the best choice for sorting a linked list

### Learning Objectives
  - How to effectively implement merge sort.
  - Its advantages/disadvantages over other sorting algorithms

### Information flow
  - Divide and conquer algorithm based on the idea of breaking down a list into sub lists of single element and then merging those sub lists into a sorted list
  - While comparing two sublists for merging, the first element of both sublists is taken into consideration. 
  - While sorting in ascending order, the element of lesser value becomes new element of the sorted list. 
  - The process is repeated until both the smaller sublists are empty and the new combined sublist consists of all elements
