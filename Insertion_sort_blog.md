### Insertion Sort
  - Insertion sort is a sorting mechanism where the input is sorted one element at a time. The input elements are sequentially compared to other elements and inserted at their specific position. This is very similar to a card being inserted at the correct position in a deck of cards.
  - It is less efficient than algorithms like quick sort or merge sort on large lists but more efficient for small data sets.
  - It is also efficient than other algorithms like selection sort or bubble sort.
  - It sorts the elements in place. So no additional space is required. Space complexity remains constant (O(1)).
  - It is efficient for input that is already substantially sorted.

### Learning Objectives
  - How to effectively implement insertion sort.
  - Its advantages/disadvantages over other sorting algorithms

### Information flow
  - Simple sorting algorithm that builds the output array one element at a time. Efficient than bubble sort or selection sort, less efficient than quicksort or mergesort.
  - Best case scenario is when input array is already substantially sorted. In this case, inserstion sort has a linear run time. The worst case is when the elements in input array are in descending order.
  - Average cases in between also do not have very good run time making it impractical to use in sorting large arrays but it is very efficiennt with arrays of smaller size.
